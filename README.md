Equity Portfolio Construction

You are working to construct an equity portfolio of 6 stocks. You have decided to choose 6 stocks out of 10 stocks you have picked up based on some initial analysis . You are investing 8,00,000 for next 10 years. Your goal is to get maximum return from the equity safeguarding the investment.

You may like to follow the following steps:

1. Each group picks up 10 stocks from the Indian stock market. Finally converging to 6 stocks in portfolio, 5 out of 6 stocks should be large cap and one should be mid cap.

2. Download 20+ years annual opening & closing prices for each stock from BSE or NSE or yahoo finance website in excel.

3. Calculate 10 years return for each stock. Find the average return and standard deviation of the return. Refer to sample for Asian Paints ( Stock Simulation) & HUL.

b. Investment in large cap should be greater than 85% of the fund.

e. Investment in any single stock should not exceed 2,00,000

f. You must invest at least 50,000 in the stock included in the portfolio.

g. Portfolio is chosen at the beginning and no switch allowed in between.

5. Submission

a. Survey of Return calculation – Read 2-3 papers and summarise the recommendations

b. Input Data in excel file as shown in the attached Excel sheet

c. Final sheet for Simulation

d. A PPT

i. Slide one Introduction to the Group

ii. Problem Introduction

iii. Methodology

iv. Simulation Results ( 1 – 2 ) slides

v. Visualization of the Results using appropriate Graphs

vi. Assumptions made

vii. Limitations of the study

6. Each group should have separate set of portfolio. One or two stocks may be common but not the whole portfolio
